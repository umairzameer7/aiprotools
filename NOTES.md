NOTES â€” Extending this project for production
- To add real AI summarization, create a server-side API route that calls OpenAI or Hugging Face inference.
- To enable grammar checking, you can call LanguageTool's public API from the server.
- To use AdSense, add your AdSense script in /pages/_document.js and insert ad slots in pages after approval.

Environment variables:
- For external APIs, add them to Vercel secrets or in a .env.local file for local dev.
